## Getting started

Clone the [macOS starter project](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Swift.StarterProject.MacOs)


## What can it be used for?

Approval Tests can be used for verifying objects that require more than a simple assert.


## Video Tutorials

You can watch a bunch of short videos on getting started and [using ApprovalTests in .Net](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0C32F89E8BBB5368) at YouTube


## Documentation

## How to get it

### Swift Package Manager

See an example [package manifest](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Swift.StarterProject.MacOs/blob/main/Package.swift#L17-L22) here

Get the following dependency

<!-- snippet: package_include_approvals -->
<a id='snippet-package_include_approvals'></a>
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        name: "ApprovalTests.Swift",
        url: "https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Swift",
        .branch("master")
        ),
],
```
<sup><a href='#snippet-package_include_approvals' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

And then add it to your test target

<!-- snippet: package_add_test_target -->
<a id='snippet-package_add_test_target'></a>
```swift
.testTarget(
        name: "ApprovalTests.Swift.StarterProject.MacOSTests",
        dependencies: [
            "ApprovalTests.Swift.StarterProject.MacOS",
            "ApprovalTests.Swift"
        ],
```
<sup><a href='#snippet-package_add_test_target' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

### Carthage

Add the following to your Cartfile:

    github "approvals/ApprovalTests.Swift" "HEAD"

Then drag the the built framework from the appropriate Carthage/Build directory into your project,
but with "Copy items into destination group's folder" disabled.


## Examples

snippet: sample_test

will produce a file `SampleTest.testList.received.txt`:

    [0] = Dan
    [1] = James
    [2] = Jason
    [3] = Katrina
    [4] = Llewellyn

Simply rename this to SampleTest.testList.approved.txt, and the test will now pass.


## Approved File Artifacts

The `*.approved.*` files must be checked into source your source control. ApprovalTests now ignores line endings by default (so you can remove `*.approved.* binary` from your .gitattributes file if you added previously).

If you would like to verify line endings, simply add `[assembly: IgnoreLineEndingsAttribute(false)]` to your AssemblyInfo.cs

Do not add `*.received.*` files to your source control (they are transitory, and some SCMs like TFS will lock them or mark them read-only, which will break every dependent test).
